## Experience
I hold a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from GA Tech and have over 16 years of experience creating novel numerical methods and writing software for physics and engineering analysis. I am a technical leader for multiple code development efforts and for creating high-order numerical methods. Several open-source code development projects that I lead are provided. 

*[MATAR](https://github.com/lanl/MATAR): Is a C++ library to support intricate data types that arise in diverse applications and extends the capabilities of the kokkos library for performance portability across multi-core CPUs and GPUs.

*[ELEMENTS](https://github.com/lanl/ELEMENTS/): Is a C++ finite element library that supports a rich set of methods and capabilities to implement numerical methods on low-order and high-order meshes.

*[Fierro](https://github.com/lanl/Fierro): Is a C++ computational mechanics code that contains a continuous finite element, discontinuous finite element (i.e., DG), and finite volume methods.  The Fierro code builds on the ELEMENTS library. The DG method is designed for high-order meshes.
